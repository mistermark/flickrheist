## About Photos hosted on the Flickr domain
Flickr makes it possible to post content hosted on Flickr to other web sites. However, pages on other web sites that display content hosted on flickr.com must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Flickr. This provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.

All the photos that are used from the Flickr hosted domain belong to their rightful owners and as such the photos will not belong to any other then their rightful owner.
